Description: Implements a LASSO regression method for multiply imputed data, combining the MI-LASSO method of Chen and Wang 2013 <doi:10.1002/sim.5783> that stacks imputed datasets and uses a group LASSO penalty for each variable across imputed datasets, the group LASSO method provided in the 'grplasso' package (Meier <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=grplasso>), and the cross-validation suggested by Gunn et al. 2023 (<doi:10.1037/met0000478>) to find optimal lambda values. Unique features include diagonal stacking that allows for different intercepts between imputed datasets, the option to not penalize some independent variables, and functionality for both linear and logistic regressions.
